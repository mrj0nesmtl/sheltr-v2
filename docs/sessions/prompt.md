# 🚀 SHELTR Development Abstract
*December 15, 2024 17:26 EST*

We're tackling a critical restructuring of SHELTR's architecture to resolve persistent dashboard loading and user profile issues. Our tree analysis revealed significant structural problems, including duplicate dashboard implementations and scattered authentication components. With authentication at 80% completion and analytics foundation laid, we're now executing a three-phase restructuring plan. The immediate focus is consolidating our directory structure, particularly merging the duplicate dashboard implementations (/Donor/Dashboard/ and /dashboard/donor/) and centralizing our auth components. This restructuring will resolve the post-login dashboard loading issues while setting up a scalable foundation for our analytics integration. We have a clear migration path, comprehensive testing strategy, and detailed success metrics in place. The next session will begin with directory consolidation, focusing first on the authentication and dashboard components, followed by implementing our new role-based routing system.
