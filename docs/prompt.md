# 🚨 SHELTR Development Session
*December 15, 2024 - Dashboard Integration Problem & Page Organization*

## 📋 Session Context
Good afternoon, We're at a crucial midpoint in SHELTR's development. With the authentication system restored and role-based access implemented, we're now focusing on integrating our dashboards and organizing our page structure for better maintainability. Today we need to take a deep dive into the project structure.  We are having terrible problem with loading the appropriate dashboards and user profiles after logging in. First Please prepare a terminal command to list the project tree.  I think you cvan exclude the massive "node_modules" and the backups folder also the.vscode directory.   Give the a tree command that you will be able to examine and detect erroneous file/folder structures or duplicate contradicting folders.  You will use this tree to degug our issues so only include in thei connant the files and directories you need to accomplish this.

## 🎯 Current Focus Areas

### 1. Dashboard Integration
```typescript
interface DashboardPriorities {
  roleBasedViews: 'Implement proper role verification',
  dataFlow: 'Connect real-time updates',
  stateManagement: 'Optimize dashboard states',
  analytics: 'Complete metrics integration'
}
```

### 2. Page Organization
```typescript
interface PageStructure {
  organization: 'Implement new directory structure',
  routing: 'Update route configurations',
  imports: 'Fix import paths',
  testing: 'Verify navigation flows'
}
```

## 📂 Key Files
```bash
