# SHELTR Development Prompt
*Session: December 10, 2024*
Welcome to the next phase of the SHELTR project, where we continue to innovate and enhance our platform to connect donors with individuals experiencing homelessness. Our mission is to 
leverage technology to facilitate direct, impactful giving through QR-enabled solutions. As we progress, our focus remains on optimizing user experience, integrating advanced features, 
and ensuring robust security.

### üéØ Current Focus
We're tackling critical user experience and routing issues while maintaining development momentum:

1. **Authentication & Routing Issues**
   ```typescript
   // Current routing logic needs refinement
   const userDashboardMap = {
     donor: '/donor/dashboard',
     participant: '/participant/dashboard',
     shelter_admin: '/shelter/dashboard',
     super_admin: '/admin/dashboard'
   };
   ```

2. **Translation Gaps**
   ```typescript
   // Missing translations in navigation
   const navTranslations = {
     'nav.dashboard': { en: 'Dashboard', fr: 'Tableau de Bord' },
     'nav.profile': { en: 'Profile', fr: 'Profil' },
     // Need to complete missing keys
   };
   ```

3. **User Testing & Onboarding**
   - User flow documentation needed
   - Testing procedures required
   - Onboarding experience improvements

## üö® Critical Issues
1. Users landing on incorrect dashboards after login
2. Navigation bar translation inconsistencies
3. Footer localization gaps
4. Missing role validation in some routes
5. Incomplete onboarding flows

## üéØ Today's Priorities
1. Fix user routing after authentication
2. Complete missing translations
3. Document user testing procedures
4. Plan onboarding improvements

## üí° Implementation Notes
- Keep role-based routing consistent with existing RBAC
- Maintain translation structure established in fr.ts
- Follow existing component patterns (see Footer refactor)
- Build on current Icon system standardization

## üîÑ Next Steps
1. Audit current auth flow
2. Map all navigation paths
3. Complete translation keys
4. Begin user testing documentation

## üìù Reference
