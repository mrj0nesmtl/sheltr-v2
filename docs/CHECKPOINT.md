### 🛠️ Technical Architecture
```typescript
// Core Stack
├── Frontend: React 18.3 + Vite 5.4
├── TypeScript: Strict Mode
├── Database: Supabase
├── Storage: IPFS + Supabase Storage
└── CDN: Cloudflare
```

### 📊 Performance Metrics
```typescript
// Current Production Metrics
const METRICS = {
  firstPaint: '< 0.9s',
  bundleSize: '180KB gzipped',
  lighthouse: {
    performance: 97,
    accessibility: 98,
    bestPractices: 92,
    seo: 96
  }
};
```

### 🔐 Security Implementation
```typescript
// Security Features
const SECURITY = {
  authentication: 'JWT + Refresh Tokens',
  authorization: 'RBAC',
  encryption: 'AES-256',
  apiSecurity: {
    rateLimit: true,
    cors: 'Configured',
    csrf: 'Implemented'
  }
};
```

### 📦 Data Storage Architecture
```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Storage["Storage Layer"]
        DB[(Supabase DB)]
        Cache[(Redis)]
        IPFS[(IPFS)]
        S3[(S3 Bucket)]
    end

    subgraph Access["Access Layer"]
        API[API Gateway]
        Query[Query Layer]
        Cache_API[Cache API]
    end

    API --> Query
    Query --> DB
    Query --> Cache_API
    Cache_API --> Cache
    API --> IPFS
    API --> S3
```
