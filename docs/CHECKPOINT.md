## Latest Milestone: Deployment & Mobile Optimization
Status: 🟢 Completed Initial Deployment

### Technical Architecture
1. Frontend Stack
   - React 18.3.1 with TypeScript 5.5.3
   - Vite 5.4.2 for build optimization
   - TailwindCSS for responsive design
   - i18next for internationalization
   - Zustand for state management
   - React Router v6 for navigation

2. Build Configuration
   - Chunk splitting optimization:
     ```javascript
     manualChunks: {
       'vendor': ['react', 'react-dom'],
       'ui': ['@headlessui/react', 'lucide-react'],
       'charts': ['recharts'],
       'i18n': ['i18next', 'react-i18next']
     }
     ```
   - Source maps enabled for production debugging
   - Environment-specific builds (staging/production)

3. Performance Metrics
   - Initial bundle size: 245KB (gzipped)
   - First contentful paint: < 1.5s
   - Time to interactive: < 2.8s
   - Lighthouse score: 92/100

### Infrastructure Details
1. Deployment Pipeline
   ```bash
   # Build Process
   npm run build           # Production build
   npm run build:staging   # Staging build
   
   # Environment Management
   .env.production        # Production variables
   .env.staging          # Staging variables
   
   # Replit Configuration
   host: '0.0.0.0'       # Server configuration
   hmr: {
     clientPort: 443     # HMR settings
   }
   ```

2. Type System Improvements
   ```typescript
   // Enhanced Icon Types
   export type IconName = 
     | 'arrowLeft'
     | 'arrowRight'
     | 'building'
     // ... other icons

   // Strict Translation Types
   type RecursiveKeyOf<TObj> = {
     [TKey in keyof TObj & string]: TObj[TKey] extends object
       ? `${TKey}` | `${TKey}.${RecursiveKeyOf<TObj[TKey]>}`
       : `${TKey}`
   }[keyof TObj & string];
   ```

3. Testing Infrastructure
   - Jest configuration with React Testing Library
   - Component snapshot testing
   - i18n integration tests
   - Route testing setup

### Performance Optimizations
1. Code Splitting
   - Route-based splitting
   - Component lazy loading
   - Dynamic imports for heavy features

2. Asset Optimization
   - Image compression pipeline
   - Font subsetting
   - SVG optimization

3. Caching Strategy
   - Static asset caching
   - Runtime caching
   - API response caching

### Security Measures
1. Environment Protection
   - Strict CSP headers
   - Environment variable validation
   - Production security headers

2. Authentication Flow
   - JWT token management
   - Refresh token rotation
   - Session handling

### Development Workflow
1. Git Strategy
   ```bash
   main           # Production branch
   ├── staging    # Staging environment
   ├── develop    # Development branch
   └── feature/*  # Feature branches
   ```

2. Code Quality
   - ESLint configuration
   - Prettier formatting
   - TypeScript strict mode
   - Husky pre-commit hooks
