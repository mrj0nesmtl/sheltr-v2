# SHELTR Project Checkpoint Summary

## Current Status

This is build V2 of SHELTR "Hacking Homelessness"
Concept by Arcana [www.arcanaconcept.com]

- ⚠️ First establish a LOCALHOST:3000
- a new V2 deployment is being planned for REPLIT
- check and verify / reconfigure all .env file
- buildout backed service using SUPABASE existing project tables

- **Critical Flows**:
  1. User registration
  2. Authentication
  3. Donation process
  4. QR code scanning
  5. Payment processing


### Core Implementation
- ✅ Basic React application structure implemented with Vite
- ✅ Internationalization (i18n) setup with English and French translations
- ✅ Core pages implemented (Home, How It Works, Solutions, etc.)
- ✅ Authentication system integrated with Supabase
- ✅ Responsive layout with Tailwind CSS

### Current Issues

- ⚠️ User Flow Issues; app crashes after logging in to any user type.
- ⚠️ Mismatched connections to appropriate user class dashboards and user experience.
- ⚠️ Shelter / NGO onboarding and properly configured connection to SUPABASE and its tables.
- ⚠️ Translation system often needing to be restored with complete EN/FR ..
- ⚠️ Truncated Localization files (eng + fr) missing sections causing errors.
- ⚠️ New local host and local network access to be established and configured.
- ⚠️ A new V2 deployment planned for REPLIT.

    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "typescript": "^5.5.3",
    "vite": "^5.4.2",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.4.1"
  }
}
```

### Backend Services (Supabase)

    "i18next": "^23.10.1",
    "lucide-react": "^0.344.0",
    "react-router-dom": "^6.22.3",
    "zustand": "^4.5.2",
    "zod": "^3.22.4"
  }
}
```

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- Login/Signup flows
- Role-based access control
- Session management
- Profile management

### Multi-language Support
- English (default)
- French
- Dynamic language switching
- Locale detection

### Core Features
- QR code scanning
- Donation processing
- Admin dashboard
- Impact analytics
- Blockchain integration (planned)

## Current Focus Areas

### High Priority
URGENT: establish a LOCALHOST:3000

1. Layout Optimization
   - Fix footer positioning
   - Eliminate excess whitespace
   - Improve responsive behavior

2. Translation System
   - Ensure all strings are translated, never truncate or comment out translation files.
   - Verify language switching
   - Add translation fallbacks

3. User Experience
   - Improve loading states
   - Add error boundaries
   - Enhance form validations

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Footer Fixes
   ```typescript
   // Layout.tsx modifications needed:
   - Adjust flex container heights
   - Implement sticky footer
   - Fix content overflow issues
   ```

2. Translation System
   ```typescript
   // Verify all translation keys in:
   - src/lib/i18n/locales/en.ts
   - src/lib/i18n/locales/fr.ts
   ```

3. UI/UX Improvements
   - Add loading skeletons
   - Implement better error handling
   - Enhance form feedback

## Critical Files to Monitor

### Layout & Structure
- `src/components/Layout.tsx` (footer fixes)
- `src/App.tsx` (routing and structure)

### Translations
- `src/lib/i18n/locales/*.ts` (translation files)
- `src/lib/i18n/index.ts` (i18n configuration)

### Core Features
- `src/components/HowItWorks.tsx`
- `src/components/Solutions.tsx`
- `src/components/Auth/*.tsx`

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
```sql
-- User Profiles
CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  role TEXT NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Donations
CREATE TABLE donations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  status TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Transactions
CREATE TABLE transactions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  type TEXT,
  amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  status TEXT
);
```

## Security Measures

### Authentication
- JWT-based authentication
- Secure password hashing
- Rate limiting
- Session management

### Data Protection
- Row Level Security (RLS)
- Input validation
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- `main` - Production ready code
- `development` - Integration branch
- `feature/*` - Feature branches
- `hotfix/*` - Emergency fixes

### Deployment Pipeline
1. Local Development
2. Feature Testing
3. Integration Testing
4. Staging Deployment
5. Production Release

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Bugs
1. Footer spacing on certain pages
2. Translation key resolution
3. Form validation edge cases

### Technical Debt
1. Need to implement proper error boundaries
2. Improve test coverage
3. Optimize bundle size
4. Add proper logging system

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. Blockchain Integration
2. Advanced Analytics
3. Mobile Application
4. Social Features

### Performance Optimizations
1. Code splitting
2. Image optimization
3. Caching strategy
4. API response optimization
