## Navigation System Refactor
### Overview
Successfully completed a major refactor of the navigation system to improve maintainability, type safety, and user experience. The refactor addressed several critical issues and established a more robust architecture.

### Key Accomplishments
1. **Navigation Architecture**
   - Centralized navigation configuration in `lib/config/navigation.ts`
   - Separated desktop and mobile navigation components
   - Implemented role-based access control for navigation items

2. **Component Structure**
   - Created dedicated `MainNav` for desktop navigation
   - Implemented `MobileNav` for responsive design
   - Consolidated icon system with proper TypeScript support

3. **Type Safety**
   - Added proper TypeScript interfaces for navigation items
   - Improved type checking for role-based access
   - Enhanced icon type definitions

### Technical Debt Addressed
- Removed duplicate navigation logic
- Eliminated conflicting component implementations
- Fixed icon system inconsistencies
- Resolved translation key issues

### Next Steps
1. Add animations to mobile menu transitions
2. Implement user profile dropdown
3. Add nested navigation support
4. Enhance accessibility features

### Timeline
- **March 12, 2024**: Navigation system refactor
- **March 15, 2024**: Planned mobile menu enhancements
- **March 20, 2024**: Scheduled accessibility improvements

### Risk Assessment
- Low: Translation key management
- Medium: Mobile responsiveness testing
- Low: Browser compatibility
