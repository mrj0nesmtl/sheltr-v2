2. Clean up unused imports
3. Fix module resolution
4. Enhance type definitions
5. Optimize build process
6. Update documentation
7. Test deployment pipeline

## Technical Notes
- Maintain strict TypeScript checks
- Follow module resolution patterns
- Keep consistent import structure
- Implement proper error handling
- Use type-safe components
- Maintain build stability
- Document type definitions

## Implementation Details
1. TypeScript Configuration
   ```typescript
   {
     strict: true,
     noImplicitAny: true,
     strictNullChecks: true,
     paths: {
       "@/*": ["./src/*"]
     }
   }
   ```

2. Core Type Definitions
   - UserRole
   - AuthState
   - RouteConfig
   - ComponentProps

## Known Issues
- TS6133: Unused imports
- TS2307: Module resolution
- TS2339: Type definitions
- Build pipeline stability

## Previous content preserved
- Reorganized project structure
- Fixed routing configuration
- Implemented role-based dashboards
- Updated navigation system
- Added NotFoundPage

## Completed Tasks
1. Role-Based Structure
   - Fixed DonorDashboard path
   - Updated ParticipantDashboard location
   - Implemented ShelterDashboard
   - Added SuperAdminDashboard
   - Updated role-based routing
   - Fixed component imports

2. Component Organization
   - Moved dashboard components to features
   - Updated import paths
   - Fixed navigation structure
   - Implemented proper lazy loading
   - Added loading states
   - Protected route enhancement

3. Routing Implementation
   - Fixed AppRoutes configuration
   - Added proper route protection
   - Implemented role-based access
   - Added loading spinners
   - Fixed 404 handling

## Next Steps
1. Create missing page components
2. Implement auth forms
3. Set up proper navigation
4. Fix remaining import paths
5. Add proper error handling
6. Implement loading states
7. Add proper TypeScript types

## Technical Notes
- Keep consistent file structure
- Maintain role-based routing
- Follow lazy loading patterns
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use suspense for loading states
- Keep routes protected
- Maintain type safety

## Implementation Details
1. Route Structure
   ```typescript
   interface RouteConfig {
     path: string
     component: React.LazyExoticComponent<any>
     roles: UserRole[]
   }
   ```

2. Core Components
   - AppRoutes
   - ProtectedRoute
   - LoadingSpinner
   - ErrorBoundary

## Known Issues
- Missing page components
- Auth form implementation
- Navigation after login
- Loading state handling
