# 🚀 SHELTR Session Planning
*Feb 13, 2024 15:45 EST*
*Version: 0.6.7*

## 📋 Situational Abstract
Following analysis of the successful Super Admin implementation, we're optimizing the Shelter Admin authentication flow. Key focus is maintaining auth state during navigation using React Router, mirroring the successful patterns from Super Admin dashboard.

## 🔄 Opening Prompt for Next Session
```typescript
@Claude We're fixing the Shelter Admin dashboard navigation in SHELTR. The Super Admin flow works perfectly, but Shelter Admin loses auth state during navigation. We need to:

1. Replace hard navigation with React Router
2. Maintain auth state during transitions
3. Mirror Super Admin's successful patterns

Current Issues:
- Auth state lost during shelter selection
- Dashboard not rendering after navigation
- URL updates but component doesn't mount

Key Files for Immediate Review:
1. src/routes/AppRoutes.tsx:
   - Update ShelterSelector navigation
   - Implement proper route handling
   - Mirror Super Admin patterns

2. src/features/dashboard/roles/shelter-admin/ShelterAdminDashboard.tsx:
   - Ensure proper mounting
   - Handle auth state consistently
   - Match Super Admin implementation

Test Accounts (Unchanged):
1. Primary QA Admin:
   - Email: joel.yaffe+admin@gmail.com
   - ID: 407ccd2a-50af-467a-a6b1-0982d043750f

2. Secondary QA Admin:
   - Email: qa.shelter@arcanaconcept.com
   - ID: a2bd925d-059b-4bf9-9e35-5d91c8231b37

Implementation Priority:
1. Fix React Router Navigation
   - Replace window.location.href
   - Use navigate from useNavigate
   - Maintain auth context

2. Auth State Persistence
   - Mirror Super Admin patterns
   - Proper state management
   - Consistent auth checks

3. Route Protection
   - Verify auth before render
   - Handle loading states
   - Proper error boundaries
```

## 📊 Implementation Status
```typescript
interface ShelterSystem {
  auth: {
    login: '✅ WORKING',
    verification: '✅ WORKING',
    routing: '🟡 FIXING',
    navigation: '🔴 CRITICAL'
  },
  dashboard: {
    layout: '🟡 IMPLEMENTING',
    features: '🟡 PLANNING',
    analytics: '🔴 NOT STARTED'
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Immediate Goals
1. Implement React Router navigation
2. Fix auth state persistence
3. Mirror Super Admin patterns
4. Ensure proper component mounting
