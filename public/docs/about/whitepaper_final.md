    struct DonationRecord {
        address donor;
        address participant;
        uint256 amount;
        uint256 timestamp;
        bytes32 paymentReference;
    }
    
    // Fund allocation constants
    uint256 public constant DIRECT_SUPPORT = 80;
    uint256 public constant HOUSING_FUND = 15;
    uint256 public constant OPERATIONS = 5;
    
    mapping(bytes32 => DonationRecord) public donations;
    
    event FundsAllocated(
        bytes32 indexed donationId,
        uint256 directSupport,
        uint256 housingFund,
        uint256 operations
    );
}
```

#### Key Components

      capabilities: string[];
    };
    DONOR: {
      permissions: string[];
      access_level: number;
      capabilities: string[];
    };
    PARTICIPANT: {
      permissions: string[];
      access_level: number;
      capabilities: string[];
    };
  };
  
  authentication: {
