# 🌟 SHELTR Platform Overview
*Version: 0.6.4 - January 20, 2024*
*Status: STABLE* 🟢

## 📝 Abstract
SHELTR is a revolutionary charitable giving platform that bridges the gap between donors and those experiencing homelessness through cutting-edge technology. By leveraging QR-code enabled direct donations, blockchain verification, and AI-driven insights, SHELTR creates a transparent, efficient, and impactful giving ecosystem. The platform enables immediate assistance while building sustainable support systems through a unique 80/15/5 fund distribution model: 80% to direct support, 15% to a sustainable housing fund, and 5% to operational costs.

Our mission is to "hack homelessness" by combining technological innovation with compassionate action, creating measurable impact through verifiable transactions, and fostering a community of engaged donors and supported individuals.

## 📊 System Architecture
The SHELTR platform is built on a modern, scalable architecture that prioritizes security, performance, and user experience.

    }
```

### 🔄 Data Flow Architecture

Our data flow architecture is built on modern web standards, implementing real-time updates and secure data handling. The system utilizes WebSocket connections for live updates, RESTful APIs for data operations, and blockchain integration for transaction verification and transparency.
