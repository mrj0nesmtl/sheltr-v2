# SHELTR V2: Transforming Charitable Giving for Homelessness

## Overview

**SHELTR V2** is a groundbreaking platform designed to revolutionize charitable giving for homelessness by leveraging the latest in **blockchain transparency**, **AI-driven insights**, **QR code donations**, and a **gamified engagement model**. Our mission is to empower homeless individuals, enhance donor confidence, and create a **sustainable pathway** to address homelessness at scale.

Built by **Arcana Concept**, SHELTR V2 operates as a **SaaS platform**, available as a **white-label solution** to shelters, NGOs, and other social service organizations worldwide, **free of cost**. The platform focuses on **transparency**, **accountability**, and **empowerment**, ensuring donations are securely and effectively used to make a meaningful impact.

## Key Features in Development

### 1. Blockchain Transparency & Public Ledger

- **Hybrid Approach**: While donations are processed via traditional payment gateways (e.g., **Stripe**, **PayPal**), **blockchain technology** is leveraged to serve as a **public ledger**, ensuring complete transparency.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automatic allocation of funds into three categories:
  - **80%** for participant essentials (e.g., food, clothing).
  - **15%** for a **housing fund**, invested in a high-yield ETF.
  - **5%** for **operational costs**, ensuring platform sustainability.

### 2. QR Code-Driven Donations

Each homeless participant receives a **unique QR code** linked to their digital wallet, making donations easy, personalized, and traceable.

- **Multi-Platform Payment Options**: Support for **Stripe**, **PayPal**, **Apple Pay**, and even **cryptocurrency wallets**.
- **Instant Donations**: Quick and secure payments, giving donors confidence in their contributions.

### 3. Financial Empowerment with AI

- **High-Yield Housing Fund**: A portion of donations is invested in a housing fund until it reaches a level sufficient to support sustainable housing solutions.

### 4. Social Media Integration & Gamification

- **Social Media Sharing**: Integration with popular platforms like **Facebook**, **Instagram**, and **TikTok** to amplify the reach of donations.
- **Milestone Badges & Rewards**: Donors and participants unlock badges as they achieve specific milestones, creating an engaging community environment.

### 5. Homeless Depot: Shopify Integration

- **Branded Marketing Materials**: Participants can access **QR code cards**, **posters**, **branded apparel**, and **digital assets** to promote their donation links through **Homeless Depot**, integrated via Shopify.
